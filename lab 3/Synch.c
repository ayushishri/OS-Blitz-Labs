-----------------------------  Semaphore  ---------------------------------

  behavior Semaphore
    -- This class provides the following methods:
    --    Up()  ...also known as "V" or "Signal"...
    --         Increment the semaphore count.  Wake up a thread if
    --         there are any waiting.  This operation always executes
    --         quickly and will not suspend the thread.
    --    Down()   ...also known as "P" or "Wait"...
    --         Decrement the semaphore count.  If the count would go
    --         negative, wait for some other thread to do an Up()
    --         first.  Conceptually, the count will never go negative.
    --    Init(initialCount)
    --         Each semaphore must be initialized.  Normally, you should
    --         invoke this method, providing an 'initialCount' of zero.
    --         If the semaphore is initialized with 0, then a Down()
    --         operation before any Up() will wait for the first
    --         Up().  If initialized with i, then it is as if i Up()
    --         operations have been performed already.
    --
    -- NOTE: The user should never look at a semaphore's count since the value
    -- retrieved may be out-of-date, due to other threads performing Up() or
    -- Down() operations since the retrieval of the count.

-----------------------------  Condition  ---------------------------------

  behavior Condition
    -- This class is used to implement monitors.  Each monitor will have a
    -- mutex lock and one or more condition variables.  The lock ensures that
    -- only one process at a time may execute code in the monitor.  Within the
    -- monitor code, a thread can execute Wait() and Signal() operations
    -- on the condition variables to make sure certain condions are met.
    --
    -- The condition variables here implement "Mesa-style" semantics, which
    -- means that in the time between a Signal() operation and the awakening
    -- and execution of the corrsponding waiting thread, other threads may
    -- have snuck in and run.  The waiting thread should always re-check the
    -- data to ensure that the condition which was signalled is still true.
    --
    -- This class provides the following methods:
    --    Wait(mutex)
    --         This method assumes the mutex has alreasy been locked.
    --         It unlocks it, and goes to sleep waiting for a signal on
    --         this condition.  When the signal is received, this method
    --         re-awakens, re-locks the mutex, and returns.
    --    Signal(mutex)
    --         If there are any threads waiting on this condition, this
    --         method will wake up the oldest and schedule it to run.
    --         However, since this thread holds the mutex and never unlocks
    --         it, the newly awakened thread will be forced to wait before
    --         it can re-acquire the mutex and resume execution.
    --    Broadcast(mutex)
    --         This method is like Signal() except that it wakes up all
    --         threads waiting on this condition, not just the next one.
    --    Init()
    --         Each condition must be initialized.

      ----------  Condition . Init  ----------
