This shell is a Unix-like shell for the BLITZ Operating System.

At the prompt (%) you can enter a command.  "stdin" and "stdout" can be
redirected using the "<" and ">" symbols.

Here are some examples:
  hello
    If it exists, the program named "hello" will be executed.
  cat < fileA > fileB
    As in Unix, except file lengths may not be changed.  Also,
    both files must exist ahead of time.
  hello > fileC
    Write the output of executing "hello" into "fileC".
  cat < script
    Print out a file called "script".
  sh < script > fileD
    This will execute a sub-shell, using commands from file "script"
    as input, and the output will be saved to "fileD".
  exit
    This command is built-in to the shell and will terminate it.

The BLITZ disk has these files to play with:
  help  --  Which you are reading
  fileA, fileB, fileC  --  Each of these has length 54
  fileD --  A file of size 1500
  script
     This file contains the following commands:

hello
cat < fileB
cat < fileA
cat < fileA > fileB
cat < fileB
hello > fileB
cat < fileB
exit

Try this:
  sh < script > fileD
  cat < fileD

What this shell does not have:
  piping, using the |
  background computation, using &
  any ability to pass command line arguments
  a lot more
