# OS-Blitz-Labs
This repository contains all completed labs from an operating systems course. The high level topics include virtualization, concurrency and persistence. The final lab (lab 8) is culmination of the entire lab work. It contains a working operating system. Specific topics include semaphores, monitors, locks, condition variables and paging.

The Blitz documentation as well as projects (labs) can be found [here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Blitz/). The projects were written in kpl. The kernel programming language (kpl) documentation can be found [here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Blitz/BlitzDoc/KPLOverview.htm)
